title: Week 13 Camera Feed Setup

Mikaela and Andrea worked together to stream the webcam feed to a website. This [tutorial](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-Raspberry-Pi-Webcam-Server-and-Stream-/) was used. The following parameters were changed, from the motion library, to create a smooth video stream.
* output_pictures = off
* stream_rate = 100
* frame_rate = 100

The video below shows the command to start the camera feed and the resulting live stream video onto a website. The resulting website is very slow because we are using a remote desktop to the Raspberry Pi rather than connecting a computer and keyboard to the Raspberry Pi directly.

The goal for next week is making the motors move using C# code rather than python and the raspberry pi, and moving the iRobot with the gear VR controller.
