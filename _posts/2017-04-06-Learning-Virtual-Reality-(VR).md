title: Week 12 Learning Virtual Reality (VR)

description: Week 12 progress report.

Andrea has successfully created a Gear VR using Unity 5 and a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 that works with the Gear VR controller. Developing VR apps isn’t necessarily different than developing a regular application. It’s more about developing an app, but with VR in mind, rather than creating a completely different type of app. This process facilitates the development of apps from current app developers.

Andrea is currently in her second Android development class at Purdue and is learning how to read accelerometer data from the phone. This data will be correlated to the rotation of the iRobot.
