Welcome to our blog! This blog tracks our project’s progress for CNIT581 Software Design and Development for Robotics, taught by Dr. Byung-Cheol Min, in Spring 2018. Our team consists of Mikaela Caron and Andrea Tidwell. Mikaela is a senior in Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering Technology and Andrea is a senior in Computer Information Technology. They are both expected to graduate in May 2018.

Last week on March 28, 2018 we presented our project proposal to the class. This week we focused on the background research required for the project. Our idea is to mount a Raspberry Pi camera module to an iRobot Roomba, view the camera feed through a Samsung Gear VR headset, and control the iRobot with the Gear VR controller. This will give the user the experience of what it’s like from the robot’s point of view. Our research and preparation for the project includes learning what is necessary to implement these technologies together.
