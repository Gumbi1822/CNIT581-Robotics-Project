Mikaela has been working on using C# to program the motors. Initially, the team had planned on using Python, but they found it more beneficial to use C# because the implementation of the motors in the VR application will be much easier. Further, the team is utilizing the Linux software Motion to stream the webcam feed to a website. Andrea is using C# with Unity to develop the VR application and move the iRobot via the Gear VR Controller. Ultimately, the team is using C# for the entire project, because it enables them to streamline the programming process.
