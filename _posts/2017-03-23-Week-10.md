After our spring break we are beginning to dive into the project head first. We have collected the components necessary for our project (more could be added later), and we are ready to begin configuration of the various devices. The following components pictured below:
1. iRobot Roomba
2. Raspberry Pi
3. EPL Camera Module
4. Dynamixel Servo Motors

Andrea has been working on the steps necessary to connect the Samsung VR headset to the raspberry pi. Mikaela has been configuring the raspberry pi to communicate with the iRobot. The goal for the next week is to know how to configure and connect all of the components together.
