description: Week 11 progress report.

Mikaela and Andrea decided to work independently this week. They decided to break up the project into two sections. Mikaela is working on one section dealing with the Raspberry Pi, camera module, and motors. Andrea is working on the Samsung Gear VR headset and controller. After figuring out each of the respective parts we will combine them to program the iRobot.
Mikaela has successfully connected the Raspberry Pi to WiFi via a WiFi module because she is using the Raspberry Pi 2. She was able to capture an image with the ELP Camera. She was able to implement the [example program](http://www.irobotweb.com/-/media/MainSite/PDFs/About/STEM/Create/Python_Tethered_Driving.pdf "Create2_TetheredDrive.py example") given by iRobot for tethered driving with Python. The iRobot was able to move by pressing the arrow keys and make a sound by pressing the spacebar.
Andrea has been working on properly setting up the development environment for the Samsung Gear VR. She is planning on creating a demo app and properly displaying it through the headset by the end of this week. She is researching which exact programs are needed to implement the VR capabilities of an Android application.
